# React shopping cart

This is a small app with some product list and the user info. The app uses React for the view and Redux to take care of the state. The only change happening to state is that when a product is checked (on checkbox) the status of the product is changed to either "RESERVED" or "NEW"

#To Start
- git clone
- cd to the dir

#Technologies Used
Webpack, babel, React, Redux, es-lint-standard, ES6 and bootstrap for styling
